npm start: To start the server
npm build: When we need to deploy our website, we require HTML, CSS, and JS files, 
so npm build helps in that. Npm build creates a build directory that contains all the HTML and CSS files. 
These files can be pasted on the hosting website to host your website. In essence, when we want to 
make our website live, we need HTML and JS files. Npm build is used for production or deployment, 
creating a build folder. Inside this folder, there is a static folder that contains all the CSS and JS files.
 Additionally, there is an index.html file that serves as the main home page.
